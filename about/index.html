  <h1>I'm a frontend developer, drummer & reader.</h1>
  <p>
    I am a frontend developer from Mexico, always thinking of creating creative stuff. I am an engineering student in computer science.
  </p>

  <h2>Past.</h2>
  <p>
    I started at age 16 creating templates. I worked in a startup development team for three years as a front end junior developer.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-right">Present.</h2>
  <p class="ml-auto text-right">
    This year I went back to one of my biggest passions, playing drums, and I started playing the piano, let's say I'm growing musically.
  </p>
  <p class="ml-auto text-right">
    I also became a reader, it is incredible how many good books I had missed out on, I wasted my time, but now I have the goal of reading
    at least twelve books this year. Right now I am reading "{{ site.book }}" by {{ site.author }}.
  </p>
  <p class="ml-auto text-right">
    I'm available for freelance work. I am also working on small open source contributions with the hyphev team.
  </p>

  <h2>Future.</h2>
  <p>
    In my future plans is to learn React, develop a video game and introduce myself to artificial intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
    To be honest, I have a long way to go and thousands of things to learn. Stay alert.
