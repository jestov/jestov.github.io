Hi, I'm jestov, a fan of web development and design in Mexico. I made this blog to share with the community useful resources that I find on the web, as well as books that I am reading in my spare time, about different topics.

It's also in my plans to upload small tutorials. Keep alert. I hope it helps at the time. Meanwhile I invite you to follow my small creative open source contributions [github][github].

Regards,

jestov.
